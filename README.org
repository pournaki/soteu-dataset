* SOtEU Dataset
This repository contains the State of the European Union speeches in machine (csv) and human (pdf) readable format. Download the latest release [[https://github.com/pournaki/soteu-dataset/releases][here]].

** Data collection
The raw data is manually collected speech by speech from https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/ and pasted into single text-files in ~./txt/raw/~, along with the URL and date of access. 

** Processing
The preambles (name of the speaker, date...) are removed and cleaned files saved in ~./txt/nopreamble/~. All speeches are combined into a single csv with the following columns, where ~doc_id~ is an integer going from 0 to N, where N is the number of speeches: 

| doc_id | date | speaker | url | text |
|--------+------+---------+-----+------|
| int    | str  | str     | str | str  |

This csv is built in Python created using 

#+begin_src bash
~ python src/speech2csv.py  
#+end_src

For reading convenience, the speeches are also saved as a pdf using

#+begin_src bash
~ python src/speech2tex.py  
~ pdflatex tex/soteu-speeches.tex
#+end_src
